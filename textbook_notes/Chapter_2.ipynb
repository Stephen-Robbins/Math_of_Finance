    "# Introduction to Options\n",

    "\n",
    "## Long and Short Positions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Long Position (Buying an Option):** The buyer of the option holds a long position. They have the right to exercise the option.\n",
    "- **Short Position (Selling/Writing an Option):** The seller or writer of the option holds a short position. They have the obligation to fulfill the contract if the buyer exercises the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Call and Put Options\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Call Option:** Gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset.\n",

    "  - For a call option, when the underlying asset price is below the strike price.\n",

    "- **Expiration Date:** The date on which the option expires. If the option is not exercised by this date, it becomes worthless.\n",
