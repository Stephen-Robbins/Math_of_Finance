    "\n",
    "## Long and Short Positions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Long Position (Buying an Option):** The buyer of the option holds a long position. They have the right to exercise the option.\n",
    "- **Short Position (Selling/Writing an Option):** The seller or writer of the option holds a short position. They have the obligation to fulfill the contract if the buyer exercises the option.\n",
    "\n",
